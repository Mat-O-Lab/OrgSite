## Toward a digital materials mechanical testing lab [^fn1]

 This paper introduces a method to digitize mechanical testing laboratories to aid the growth of Industry 4.0 technologies. It uses detailed and standard-compliant materials testing knowledge graphs and tools for efficient ontology development, converting heterogeneous mechanical testing data into machine-readable, uniform, and standardized structures. The mechanical testing ontology (MTO) is based on ISO 23718 and ISO/IEC 21838-2 standards for representing mechanical testing data. The approach was successfully applied to a trial digitalization of a materials testing lab, converting various forms of data into standardized RDF formats. The method enables industries to access reliable, traceable data from various sources, facilitating faster and more cost-effective product development and improved product performance in engineering and ecological aspects.
