<h1>About</h1>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>
The Materials Open Laboratory, short Mat-O-Lab, is a Joint Venture of Fraunhofer Group Materials and The Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM). Our shared Vision is to describes material science human and machine readable, proving the use from laboratory to product.
</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
Mat-O-Lab stands for the digitization of materials, parts and components along their entire life cycle. 
For that purpose, concrete practical and applicable solutions for pilot cases centered
about specific materials are developed and provide for public use. 
Key results (datasets, ontologies, tools for data structuring and data analysis) 
from parallel research projects are consolidated and constantly improved. Mat-O-Lab also stands 
for a new, open and agile collaboration between the institutes of the Fraunhofer Group Materials 
and Components (MATERIALS), the Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM) 
and interested partners from industry and academia.
