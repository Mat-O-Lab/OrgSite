## About

### Vision
The Materials Open Laboratory, short Mat-O-Lab, is a Joint Venture of Fraunhofer Group Materials and The Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM). Our shared Vision is to describe material science in human and machine-readable formats, proving its use from laboratory to product.

### Mission
Mat-O-Lab stands for the digitization of materials, parts, and components along their entire life cycle. For that purpose, concrete practical and applicable solutions for pilot cases centered around specific materials are developed and provided for public use. Key results (datasets, ontologies, tools for data structuring and data analysis) from parallel research projects are consolidated and constantly improved. Mat-O-Lab also stands for a new, open, and agile collaboration between the institutes of the Fraunhofer Group Materials and Components (MATERIALS), the Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM), and interested partners from industry and academia.

### Board

**Dr. phil. nat. Ursula Eul & Dr. rer. nat. Jens Rie­del** | Members of the Executive Board
