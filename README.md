# Mat-O-Lab Org Web Site

The Materials Open Laboratory, short Mat-O-Lab, is a Joint Venture of Fraunhofer Group Materials and The Bundesanstalt f端r Materialforschung und -pr端fung (BAM). Our shared Vision is to describes material science human and machine readable, proving the use from laboratory to product.

## Introduction
Mat-O-Lab stands for the digitization of materials, parts and components along their entire life cycle. For that purpose, concrete practical and applicable solutions for pilot cases centered about specific materials are developed and provide for public use. Key results (datasets, ontologies, tools for data structuring and data analysis) from parallel research projects are consolidated and constantly improved. Mat-O-Lab also stands for a new, open and agile collaboration between the institutes of the Fraunhofer Group Materials and Components (MATERIALS), the Bundesanstalt f端r Materialforschung und -pr端fung (BAM) and interested partners from industry and academia.
